  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago my boss sent round a link to a post from <a href="http://37signals.com/">37 Signals</a>, <a href="https://37signals.com/svn/posts/3357-an-office-with-library-rules">An office with &#8220;library rules&#8221;</a>, with the question, &#8220;I always wonder if this would be a good idea?&#8221;. At the time I wrote a quick response and afterwards thought I&#8217;d share it here, so this is my take on &#8220;Library rules/silence&#8221;.</p>

<p><em>A bit of background, in our room at the office we generally have music playing in the background to the entire room, people including myself wear headphones and listen to their own music, and we also have a lot of people coming and going like account managers and people from different parts of the office.</em></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think &#8220;library silence&#8221; or rules like that would work to be honest, for one does that mean the music stops? Would that therefor mean we all resort to headphones?</p>

<p>There certainly are times when it gets loud in here for all the conversations that are going on, I&#8217;ve donned headphones a number of times because I literally can&#8217;t think for the noise&#8230; but how we deal with taking those conversations away from the people working is the hard thing. Meeting rooms for conversations I don&#8217;t think would work, the noise build up I&#8217;m talking about is from multiple conversations at the same time and are relatively short, so moving them would be even more of a disturbance for the people having the short conversation.</p>

<p>Then again things like some account managers impromptu meetings bringing 3-4 extra people in here crowding round a desk are a different beast entirely, things like that would be great to have cut out. Generally account managers do come and go causing interruptions now and then, but that&#8217;s not down to them entirely, it&#8217;s down to the whole process of client work, it is disruptive, but I guess then you could argue account managers are there to buffer that disruption and allow us the space/time to work&#8230;</p>

<p>So basically what I&#8217;m trying to say is, yes, it would be great to be more distraction free and reduce the unnecessary interruptions/noise, but doing that in here would take some work, cultivating not only a culture amongst our team but almost in the company as a whole - to a degree&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Late last year saw the release of the latest default theme offering from WordPress the next of the Twenty-somethings, TwentyTwelve.</p>

<p>In this post I&#8217;m going to take a quick look through what&#8217;s new in the latest default theme. What new features there are for content editors and what designers/developers can learn.</p>

<p>The first thing to mention however is that WordPress has now gone fully responsive! The WordPress blog calls TwentyTwelve &#8220;a thoughtfully crafted mobile-first layout&#8221;, the TwentyEleven theme did respond in size certainly, but TwentyTwelve is a much more considered execution.</p>

<h2>New design</h2>

<p>The new WordPress default theme has certainly put a lot more emphasis on a content-driven approach to design. It&#8217;s very minimalist with a lot of whitespace and clean/clear navigation both on desktop and a nice execution on mobile. The typography of the TwentyTwelve theme also adds to it with the fantastic  Open Sans typeface served via Google Web Fonts.</p>

<p>WordPress is now seen as much more than just a blogging platform, this too is clearly echoed in the new theme - perhaps controversially so. There is now a new homepage template design, taking away the post listing and giving you the chance to use a custom page as your homepage with 2 widget areas.</p>

<p><img src="/images/screenshot-1.png" alt="new homepage layout" /></p>

<p>Other features include the introduction of a full-width page template removing the sidebar where you choose, another example of the content-first nature of the theme. And post formats are now carried over to the single post pages where in TwentyEleven the formatting found in the post listing would be lost in the single page template.</p>

<h2>New development techniques</h2>

<p>The new TwentyTwelve theme also looks pretty different when you dig down into the code and see the various changes introduced. For starters the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> declaration has come down from 44 lines of code in TwentyEleven to just 10 lines in TwentyTwelve, mainly by moving more functions into the <code>functions.php</code>. That also includes the main stylesheet call being applied with <code>wp_enqueue_style()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// Code

/*
    * Loads our main stylesheet.
*/
wp_enqueue_style( 'twentytwelve-style', get_stylesheet_uri() );
</code></pre>

<p>Speaking of the stylesheet, lots of work has gone into making this a truly responsive theme and this can be seen no better than in the use of REMs in the stylesheet for all of the main sizing for the theme. Meaning the design will also respond well to adjustments made to the default text size.</p>

<p><img src="/images/screenshot-2.png" alt="responsive layout with adjusted default text size" /></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier there are 2 new page templates available in the TwentyTwelve theme, <code>front-page.php</code> and <code>full-width.php</code> which can be found in the page-templates folder. The front page template will get called if a custom home page has been used for the theme and pages will be styled the same as the full-width page template should the user remove all widgets from the main sidebar.</p>

<p>The new offering from WordPress in the TwentyTwelve theme clearly shows how well WordPress has evolved over the years to become one of the top content management systems on the web. There&#8217;s a reason over 56 million websites are powered by it. The new TwentyTwelve theme clearly shows that they are continuing to develop with the times and the industry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the past year has been pretty incredible/overwhelming/busy and everything in between really, so I thought I&#8217;d write a quick summary of all the stuff that&#8217;s gone on. Sorry if this seems an awfully long rambling post but I really just wanted somewhere to get down what actually happened last year and reflect on it personally really, so apologies if I go on a bit&#8230;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick summary of the things that have happened:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attended a bunch of conferences</li>
<li>Began conference speaking</li>
<li>Changed job</li>
<li>Moved to London</li>
<li>Started lecturing at Oxford Brookes</li>
<li>Helped kick off <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk">CodeClub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://onishiweb.github.com/blog/2012/09/17/burnout/">Struggled with Burnout</a></li>
<li>Attempted the Tour de Trigs (a 24 hour 50 mile cross country hike)</li>
<li>Organised another <a href="http://12devsofxmas.co.uk">12 Devs of Xmas</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Conferences</h2>

<p>This year for me has been a lot about conferences, learning, and meeting a heck of a lot of people! After having a look through my accumulated lanyards from the past year here&#8217;s the list of events I&#8217;ve attended:</p>

<ul>
<li>jQuery UK (Oxford)</li>
<li>DIBI (Newcastle)</li>
<li>Reasons to be Appy (London)</li>
<li>Reasons to be Creative (Brighton)</li>
<li>Points Brighton</li>
<li>Web Developer Conference (Bristol)</li>
<li>HandHeld Conference (Cardiff)</li>
<li>Milton Keynes Geek Night (all three!)</li>
<li>As well as many mini-events like Ubelly Ignite and some Mozilla events.</li>
</ul>


<p>Looking back it&#8217;s a heck of a list! And I can&#8217;t say there was a single one that I felt did a bad job. Every single event was packed full of great talks, amazing speakers, and the opportunity to meet and chat to loads of great people in our industry.</p>

<p>Looking forward to this year I&#8217;ve actually decided to make a conscious decision to cut back a bit on the conference front, save up some money and look at doing different things. I&#8217;m finishing off my run of conferences later this month with New Adventures. I attended the first year of this amazing event and after missing out on the second year I had to get back the 3rd (and possibly final year). It won&#8217;t be my only conference of the year I&#8217;m sure, I&#8217;ll probably be looking to attend Build in the latter part of the year but for now I need a bit of a break.</p>

<h2>Conference Speaking</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been extremely fortunate this year to have been invited to speak at a few conferences. Whether to a room of just 20 or so people or in front of hundreds it&#8217;s been pretty incredible. Here&#8217;s the short list of the talks I&#8217;ve done this year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Milton Keynes Geek Night #1 - Code Club</li>
<li>Ubelly Ignite - Code Club</li>
<li>Reasons to be Creative - <a href="http://onishiweb.github.com/blog/2012/09/05/designer-developer-relationship/">The Designer Developer Relationship</a></li>
<li>Reasons to be Creative Ubelly Soapbox - <a href="http://onishiweb.github.com/blog/2012/09/17/burnout/">Burnout</a></li>
<li>Points Brighton - Burnout</li>
<li>Milton Keynes Geek Night #3 - Misadventures with Burnout</li>
</ul>


<p>So far most of these have been short 5 min talks, with the exception of Points where I was able to go on for about 15-20 minutes or so. By far the craziest one was Reasons to be Creative as part of the Gimme 5 slot! 12 people doing 5 minute slots each, back to back with absolutely no time for switch over! We went through 4 rehearsals and various stages of encouragement and advice from John Davey and the team at Reasons, it was crazy and to be honest not my best talk this year but it&#8217;s an experience I won&#8217;t ever forget.</p>

<p>The talk I&#8217;ve been most confident with so far is the Burnout talk, I&#8217;ve done this 3 times now and each time I&#8217;ve been able to improve it and improve my delivery as well which going by <a href="https://vimeo.com/56088069">the video</a>, it still needs a lot of improving.</p>

<h2>New job</h2>

<p>In August of this year I left the amazing team at <a href="http://oneltd.co.uk">One Ltd</a> to find newer pastures. I felt it was time to move on and with a real pull towards moving to London I joined the web team at <a href="http://www.bigfish.co.uk">Big Fish</a> as a Front-end Developer. I loved my 3 years at One, it was my first job coming from University, where I learned pretty much everything! They took a chance with me and I really appreciate that.</p>

<p>The move to Big Fish has so far been a great experience as well, working with some fantastic brands, learning a heck of a lot of stuff I had only just started to touch on at One and feeling well and truly like they have a great approach to working in an ever evolving industry.</p>

<h2>Made the move to London</h2>

<p>For the first few month&#8217;s of the new job at Big Fish I was commuting to London from Banbury every day. However I soon started to get very sick of the 6am starts and not getting home till 8.30pm! So after spending 6 weeks or so house sitting for a friend in South East London and moving my mum into my vacant flat in Banbury I was able to find a house share in central London just south of the river and only 20 minutes from work!</p>

<p>It took a little while but after a few months of unrest I&#8217;m now pretty much settled in London and so far really enjoying it. For one thing it&#8217;s enabled me to attend a ton more mini-events and meet a load of new people in the industry, so while I may not be attending many conferences this year I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be plenty social at the various events that always crop up around town.</p>

<h2>Lecturing at Brookes</h2>

<p>As well as speaking at a few conferences this year I&#8217;ve also managed to do 2 lectures at Oxford Brookes about working in the web industry giving students a look at what they can look forward to should they decide to join our amazing industry. It&#8217;s been really rewarding so far and I&#8217;ve had some good feedback from the students and lecturer.</p>

<p>Having industry professionals go into Universities and talk to current students about current techniques and technology is something I feel very strongly about. With the constraints on academic institutes keeping the curriculum up to date can be a real struggle so it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m going to be working on a lot this year as well hopefully.</p>

<h2>The 12 Devs of Xmas</h2>

<p>The year closed off with the second coming of the <a href="http://12devsofxmas.co.uk">12 Devs of Xmas</a>. We actually started discussing the site and asking authors back in the summer so it&#8217;s been worked on throughout most of the second half of 2012 but once again it was quite a long and at times stressful process. But that&#8217;s a whole other post entirely which I hope to get writing soon.</p>

<h2>A heck of a year</h2>

<p>Ok so I&#8217;m going to stop there as it&#8217;s starting to get a bit longer than I&#8217;d expected. There&#8217;s a few things I haven&#8217;t covered, like working with the amazing <a href="http://twitter.com/hyper_linda">Linda Sandvik</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/claresutcliffe">Clare Sutcliffe</a> on <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk">Code Club</a> - and standing in for them on a couple of talks (sometimes at very short notice). Going to my first ever hack day, and training for and attempting the 24 hour 50 mile Tour de Trigs hike with Chris &amp; Graham - unfortunately falling ill on the day and only managing a measly 16 miles.</p>

<p>To be honest I&#8217;m hoping 2013 is a lot quieter than last year, I&#8217;m going to settle into London and the new job a bit more hopefully and try to work on a lot more side projects I have kicking about the place.</p>

<p>Finally to all those I&#8217;ve met this year, thank you all for being superb and amazing people, I can&#8217;t imagine working in an industry without you guys!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m just starting to play with new technologies and techniques for blogging, the first two I&#8217;ve chosen are <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> - this one - and <a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogram</a>. I&#8217;m yet to publish anything on Scriptogram but I&#8217;m thinking of putting content on there and here then seeing which is easiest to write to and manage over the coming months. My aim is to find something that makes writing easier and focuses me on that instead of putting a redesign ahead of creating content.</p>

<p>Others platforms I&#8217;m considering are <a href="http://modx.com/">ModX</a>, <a href="http://grabaperch.com/">Perch</a>, and <a href="http://statamic.com/">Statamic</a> - the last two are paid for though so I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be trying out those for such a temporary solution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently read a post by a friend, <a href="http://www.byrichardpowell.co.uk">Richard Powell</a>, <a href="http://www.byrichardpowell.co.uk/post/30923997379/you-are-not-an-expert">You&#8217;re not an expert, but that&#8217;s ok</a>. In which he says:</p>

<blockquote>I often suggest that designers and developer run a workshop to share their knowledge only to hear: “I couldn’t give a workshop, I’m not an expert”</blockquote>


<p>I can understand where people are coming from when they say that, I had very similar thoughts a while ago when I was thinking of running a WordPress workshop. However there is something I have found extremely useful when it comes to preparing a lecture, a talk and most certainly when working towards putting on a workshop. The best way to learn a subject and become an expert is by teaching it to someone else.</p>

<p>It reminds me of a quote in Dirk Gently&#8217;s Holistic Detective Agency by Douglas Adams:</p>

<blockquote>What I mean is that if you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your own mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas. […] By the time you’ve sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you’ve certainly learned something about it yourself. The teacher usually learns more than the pupil.</blockquote>


<p>Granted in context the quote is describing the art of programming, but I think it&#8217;s a great statement about teaching in general. To be able to explain something well to another person you need to truly understand it yourself. That being the case I would say that by running a workshop or giving a talk it will enable you to learn a subject so thoroughly that you might well consider yourself more of an expert afterwards than when you began.</p>

<p>So essentially what I&#8217;m saying is just what Richard is, go and put on workshops, it will be of benefit to you just as much as it will be to the people you will be teaching.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the last year or so my involvement in the web industry exploded; I began to look at my career as a love and much more than a job. I enjoyed working so much it was no longer constrained to 9-5, evenings and most weekends were spent doing what I loved, tapping away at code or reading books and blogs. I was having great fun and earning money, what more can you ask for in life.</p>

<p>In 1972 Herbert J. Freudenberger defined burnout as &#8220;a demon born of the society and times we live in and our ongoing struggle to invest our lives with meaning. It is not a condition that gets better by being ignored. Nor is it any kind of disgrace. On the contrary, it’s a problem born of good intentions.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few months ago I started losing the passion for my work, instead of spending weekends working I spent them trying to find things to get me away from it. I had reached the point where I had a lot of work, lots of free time and it was the last thing I wanted to do. I started concentrating on paying work only; I put off side projects and things that I had previously enjoyed doing. I felt like I was letting down friends, clients, and most of all myself.</p>

<p>Burnout can manifest itself in many ways. Your behaviour can change, becoming more aggressive, cynical and frustrated with things. You feel empty and apathetic towards your work. In worse cases it can lead to depression and what is known as burnout syndrome, causing mental breakdown, physical collapse and possible, suicidal thoughts. Luckily I can only relate to a couple of those.</p>

<p>Sitting here now I see what happened and try to work with it so I&#8217;m no longer as badly affected. I don&#8217;t feel nearly as bad as I once did. However this realisation didn&#8217;t come on it&#8217;s own; I read a post by <a href="http://rawkes.com/">Rob Hawkes</a> about his <a href="http://rawkes.com/articles/one-year-at-mozilla">first year at Mozilla</a>. He spoke about how amazing it had been but also how hard the constant travel and work was, and how after a while he too felt the effects of burnout. I spoke with him briefly afterwards on Twitter and it was nice to have someone I could talk to that I could relate to and have an open conversation with.</p>

<p>Topics like this can be very personal, but affect more people than are willing to admit. By talking about it, I&#8217;m hoping others will realise it&#8217;s not just them, it&#8217;s common and it&#8217;s manageable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a web developer for a few years now, mainly working at an agency, but with some freelance experience too. Generally this has meant the projects I work on will usually be alongside a designer, a situation which I&#8217;m sure many people are familiar with. This designer/developer relationship will therefore form the basis of their work together and I believe to produce great work you need a great working relationship. For me personally it&#8217;s been a bit of a love/hate experience and I&#8217;d like to share some of those experiences here and look at how it can be made into a much more enjoyable partnership for both roles.</p>

<p>From my experiences I&#8217;m yet to work with many designers who know that much, if anything, about coding. And for the most part I&#8217;m terrible at designing! However I&#8217;m not here to say that designers should learn code and developers should learn to design&#8230; In my opinion it&#8217;s each to their own. If you want to learn another discipline that&#8217;s great and no doubt it will help with your work and your understanding of the wider picture. I&#8217;ve worked on teams though, where people are either out-and-out designers or developers and they are still extremely successful, in that situation it&#8217;s been because of a strong collaboration between the pair that makes the team successful. Unfortunately that&#8217;s not always the case and sometimes there can be disagreement, conflict and ill feelings towards one another. I&#8217;d like to look at how we can prevent things like that from happening and create a relationship which leads to great work and a good feeling between both designer and developer.</p>

<h2>I love my job</h2>


<p>Put simply, I love my job! I&#8217;m a terrible designer, but when given a flat design I can turn that into a masterpiece of code - well I like to think so anyway - and I really enjoy it. I think if I were to design as well as code I wouldn&#8217;t be able to produce anything close to what I do now working alongside a designer. Having someone to work alongside and bounce ideas off is fantastic, as great as it feels to produce a brilliant piece of individual work, there no feeling like working with someone, being inspired by their ideas and having them respond excitedly to something you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>And I love the challenge! If I were to design things for myself I don&#8217;t think I would be able to generate freedom from the code, I would design things knowing that I could code them easily or similar to something I&#8217;ve already seen. With a designer who doesn&#8217;t work with code they&#8217;re not bound as much by those contraints, they can design something which they think will look and work great and be as creative in that process as possible and it&#8217;s my job to work out how to turn that into code, and that&#8217;s where I get to have fun.</p>

<h2>The not so good bits, and how easy they are to fix</h2>


<p>Although the designer/developer relationship can be amazing and lead to some fantastic results, there are some things that can interrupt that creative process and cause the relationship to sour. There may be times where a designer or developer - whether internally or openly - believes that their discipline is superior and should be considered more important in the process, which is absolute rubbish. But I think Cassie McDaniel put this a little more eloquently in her post on the subject &#8220;Copy, art, typography — and technology — are the bones of a project, where design and development are the joints and skin that connect and hold together the parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>So putting aside egos, there are some common circumstances which we may come across through the course of a working relationship that are going to cause issues in the final outcome and maybe damage the relationship for further projects. One positive I mentioned earlier, that designers who aren&#8217;t that knowledgeable about code are more free from the constraints a developer might feel, can sometimes be a downside too. At times designers I&#8217;ve worked with at least - I&#8217;m sure that it&#8217;s not just me - have sold concepts to a client which, that when it comes time to build aren&#8217;t as simple as the designer thought and have either been under-sold or not given the necessary time to complete. This can be easily solved simply by communication, just speaking to the developer about the proposed solution before the client is sold the concept can mean it can be adjusted to work better for the clients budget or the client can be made aware of possible extra time/money needed for a solution which is best suited to them.</p>

<p>Developers can also be a pain when they choose to speak in too much technical detail about what they want to do or are doing on a project. Learn to talk more human language, just because you know exactly what you mean, it doesn&#8217;t mean the everyone else will - including the designer who needs to understand. Explain things clearly and easily and you&#8217;ll have a much better chance of getting the idea accross or comments on the design understood so something can actually be done about it.</p>

<p>Both parties need to stay up to date as well, developments in the industry, new ideas, tools and techniques. I probably don&#8217;t have to tell that to people reading this post or who saw this talk because clearly you&#8217;re already doing that. But what about the others in your office, is the developer you work with here as well, or are they back in the office because they couldn&#8217;t afford to come or don&#8217;t think they gain that much from conferences. If that&#8217;s the case it&#8217;s then your job to go back to them with all of these new fantastic ideas that you&#8217;ve picked up and expose them to it. After Reasons to be Creative I&#8217;m planning on going back into the office and doing a short talk to tell people about what I&#8217;ve learned there so they can take away some of the things I have.</p>

<h2>Work more closely as a team</h2>


<p>The biggest issue I think I have though is when a designer/developer relationship just isn&#8217;t that at all, when it turns into a conveyor belt process where things are just handed on from one person to the next and people have no involvement in anything outside their own discipline. This isn&#8217;t just bad practice but it&#8217;s extremely detrimental to the working relationship and can lead to people feeling completely removed from the project as a whole, resenting the work, and other members of the team. The most effective way to solve this is to include everyone in the process right from the start, having developers in meetings earlier and even with the client can lead to better results and sometimes more creative ideas, as developers know how to bend the technology to solve certain problems, something a designer might not have the technical know-how for. Throughout the process as well I think it&#8217;s important that both the designer and developer remain in touch with each other, talking about what&#8217;s going on both in design and development, it means we have to make ourselves available to each other and to willingly engage at all stages of the project. If there are problems discuss them openly and don&#8217;t be snarky, learn to give <a title="Mark Boulton - It's not working for me #crit" href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/its-not-working-for-me-crit">better critique and how to take criticism openly</a>.</p>

<p>Another possible solution is to look at your process as a whole, a lot of people are still working to a waterfall like process where maybe now we could be thinking more agile. Working closely together to produce something quickly and iteratively. With the move into a more responsive web as well this can only be a good thing, otherwise it could lead to designers producing multiple versions of each page design when a conversation with a developer or working to create it in the browser as soon as possible would be much more appropriate. For an example you could take a look at <a title="Andy Clarke" href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke&#8217;s</a> recent <a title="Andy Clarke - Designing for ISO" href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/designing_for_iso">case study of the agile process</a> he used when rebuilding the new <a title="ISO - International Organization for Standardization" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html">responsive ISO website</a>.</p>

<h2>Why should we bother</h2>


<p>Now what I&#8217;ve said is great in theory of course, but it may mean a lot of work for some companies, breaking their current process or some might think, it&#8217;s all well and good but when you&#8217;re trying to earn money there&#8217;s time to worry about relationships. So let me just give you a few reasons why I think this is important.</p>

<p>Getting a developer involved earlier in the process and working more closely as a team throughout the project can lead to people feeling more compassion for the project. A developer understanding why a design decision has been made because they&#8217;ve been involved in the meetings with the client that explained them. Or the designer having a developer there to help with a possible solution to give them technical advice they need at the right time may help them avoid going back over the design again after they&#8217;ve already put a lot of work into it.</p>

<p>If you think of the designer/developer relationship in terms of the partnership between driver and co-driver in a rally team. Both have their own speciality, both would be useless without the other. If they don&#8217;t have a good working relationship, communicate well and use each other to do the best job possible they&#8217;re not going to win anything. They have their individual jobs to do and they prepare and work on them a little separately I&#8217;m sure, but when it comes to the race, they&#8217;re side by side working together to get the best time.</p>

<p>And if they don&#8217;t work well together, there&#8217;s inevitably going to be a crash at some point!</p>

<h2>Hug it out</h2>


<p>The relationship between designer and developer can be irritating at times, there can be bad feelings, poor communication or none at all. But without each other we wouldn&#8217;t be able to create the amazing, inspiring websites we do and have fun in the process. We work best as a team when we complement each other and work towards a similar goal, so before you go into your next project, find the developer/designer you&#8217;re working with, and hug it out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve wanted to write about responsive web design for some time now but the previous post I was writing became very bloated and out of date very quickly over the process of writing it so, I gave up&#8230;however after seeing a talk last night by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/amberweinberg">Amber Weinberg</a> at <a title="Points Means Pixels" href="http://www.onishiweb.co.uk/2012/05/points-means-pixels/">Points Brighton</a> about mobile development and the process she uses I thought I would take 5 mins to look at how I&#8217;ve worked when developing responsive sites.</p>

<p>The main point Amber brought up in her talk was whether there is a need for a mobile first approach or a desktop first approach when it comes to development. Now I want to be very clear here that we are both talking about from a development point of view as neither of us are designers. Amber didn&#8217;t touch on design aspects but for me web design should ideally be based on mobile first or more accurately, content first; now I am not in a position at my company where I can tell the designers how to go about their jobs but I feel that if you&#8217;re going to aim for a responsive website the content needs to be king, and by designing mobile first this focuses the design more around the content. But I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot of opinion on this and as I&#8217;m no designer I will leave that to the rest of them to fight over.</p>

<p>Right, so back to my point, responsive development. When building the <a href="http://www.palagioproducts.com/">Il Palagio</a> website, I was given only desktop designs and one version of how the homepage might look for mobile, so my options here for development were pretty limited, do I build it mobile first or do I start with designs I&#8217;ve been given and work desktop first. Of course I opted for the latter seen as I had a design to work from. So my development starts with a normal desktop build based on fixed widths from the designs I&#8217;m working with, which I then turn fluid in the usual manner (with a max-width). This means I now have a fluid website which will at some point break when you shrink the viewport down.</p>

<p>Now this is the bit where it gets more interesting. At the time I was building this site I came across an <a title="Case study in best practice: Real Life Responsive Design" href="http://boagworld.com/season/2/episode/s2e7/">article on Boagworld</a> which is a transcript of a conversation between <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/boagworld">Paul Boag</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/beep">Ethan Marcotte</a> from one of the Boagworld Podcasts, it&#8217;s pretty good if somewhat lengthy but there was one question Paul asked Ethan that I think shows a fantastic approach to working with responsive designs from the desktop first:</p>

<blockquote>That’s usually the first thing that I build is I sort of build the desktop view of the site. [&#8230;]

Then what I’ll do is I’ll kind of go back at the top of my style sheets and I’ll actually start going kind of rule by rule and just sort of picking out the properties that actually have to do with layout.

[&#8230;]

Then anything that sort of I think is best fit for the top end of the resolution spectrum, right in line, right after that rule I’ll actually just create a media query and then just sort of drop in all those properties that I think are just widescreen only, for example. Then I’ll basically work my way all the way down the style sheet essentially kind of quarantining out anything that’s layout specific. So by the end, there is nothing outside those media queries that has anything to do with something that wouldn’t be accessible to a small screen. So then I go back over the top of the style sheet and I’ll take all those media queries and basically just consolidate them all down at the bottom.</blockquote>


<p>Ethan Marcotte speaking to Paul Boag on his approach to responsive development.</p>

<p>I really like this approach, I take all of my CSS that is layout specific and would only work for a wider viewport and I strip that out and put it in appropriate min-width media queries at the bottom of the styles (or in separate stylesheets that are called after the main). I make sure I spend time looking at which breakpoints each particular part of the layout falls down in the design and strip it out and create this series of media queries (limiting to 3-4 depending on what is breaking where). This way it means that all the original design goes into as many versions of the site before I have to start changing things. And from this point what I&#8217;m left with in the main style is as Ethan says in the post, mostly just typography and elements that will fit into any viewport. Now I&#8217;ll just work with the styles I have and amend the website to work in the main breakpoints that I have set out in the initial &#8220;quarantining&#8221; phase.</p>

<p><em>Also just a quick note on breakpoints, I generally stay away from common breakpoints and device specific sizes because even at the moment there&#8217;s such a varied market it&#8217;s better to make sure a site works at all sizes, not just the ones we know (also that&#8217;s future proof too - go me!).</em></p>

<p>Where possible with my media queries I also try to mainly use min-width media queries so that any styles I write for different queries cascade into one another so nothing I write goes to waste. It isn&#8217;t always possible but I like to try to avoid writing 3-4 min and max-width media queries as essentially it means I&#8217;m writing 3-4 different layouts.</p>

<p>One final point I would like to make is that while I may start with the desktop first my stylesheets are always based mobile up, which I think should be fairly common sense but I feel I had better mention this just in case. The whole point of building the CSS up from mobile first is that you&#8217;re exposing the smallest amount of CSS possible to smaller devices and then adding more as the viewport size builds up (not that it means speed builds up with it but we haven&#8217;t quite got to speed detecting media queries yet), and so are increasing the actual impact on that smaller resolutioned device - something that Andy Clarke has taken into account in the updated 320 and up framework.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s my current approach to responsive development, I&#8217;m still fairly new to this whole world - so far I only have about 4-5 responsive builds under my belt - so I&#8217;m sure my techniques will develop over time as I take on new ideas and the whole responsive movement matures a bit. I think we&#8217;re all still going to have varying techniques and approaches when it comes to responsive web design and development, and I think mostly our methods will depend a lot on the context in which we&#8217;re working. This approach works well for me as I&#8217;m always going to be served designed aimed at the desktop. If you have any thoughts on this I&#8217;d love to hear what you have to say so feel free to leave a comment or tweet me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I took the very substantial journey from Oxford all the way down to Brighton to attend the second <a href="http://www.pointsbrighton.co.uk/">Points Brighton</a> mini-conference. I missed the previous one but after this time building the website for the event I decided I could not possibly miss out on it a second time round. Points boasted a diverse line-up of speakers and topics, and at only £5 per ticket with all proceeds going to the fantastic charity <a href="http://remysharp.com/tias-trees/">Tia&#8217;s Trees</a> it was more than worthwhile.</p>

<p>The venue was <a href="http://www.theskiff.org/">The Skiff</a> a small co-working and meeting space in central Brighton, we took up a small area towards the back of the venue and despite it&#8217;s size the limited number of people kept it comfortably busy without feeling like we were squashed in like sardines in a tin.</p>

<p>The first speaker up was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/amberweinberg">Amber Weinberg</a> talking about mobile development; Amber was a late replacement for <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/paulmist">Paul Mist</a> who couldn&#8217;t make it due to illness. Amber&#8217;s talk looked at how mobile development needs to be more seriously considered now and covered the various routes you could take to tackle such a wide range of devices and viewports; she then took us through a couple of case studies of her recent work, which I enjoyed. Amber also spoke about how she feels mobile-first development is quite possibly a bad choice in that she is normally served with only desktop based designs and has to work with the design herself to produce the mobile versions. I kind of agree with her on this point but there are some things I would like to add to her approach, but I&#8217;ll save that for another post&#8230;</p>

<p>The next speaker was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jamesslock">James Seymour-Lock</a> with a talk on achieving your clients goals. I&#8217;m working with clients on a day to day basis and have been recently inspired by Paul Boag&#8217;s book and podcast on the subject of client centric design so was particularly interested in seeing James&#8217; talk. James spoke about more carefully defining the clients goals as invariably the client has too many things they want their website to achieve (or too few in my experience) and focusing them on the main objectives. And also building a relationship with the client and getting to know their personality, how many of us can say that our client has ever challenged us to handstand competition over Skype!?</p>

<p>The third speaker of the night was <a href="http://www.bozboz.co.uk/">Krystian Szastok</a>, and a hush came over the room as he introduced his talk about SEO and in particular the principle of factor sparsity or the 80/20 rule. Now I think this was one of the hidden gems of the night, for what at first could seem a fairly dull subject to most Krystian proceeded to make into an interesting talk covering the real aspects of good SEO. The 80/20 rule was first applied to off and on site SEO, 80% of your search ranking is made up from the actual popularity of your site, so off-site links and directory listings are important. Of the 20% on site optimisation, content is key, if your website is about Oxfordshire Web Development, those 3 words need to appear in the content! Krystian also covered things like good HTML Titles, meta descriptions (not necessarily unique to each page but if possible this should be the case) and good alt tags for images (something like image1.jpg just doesn&#8217;t cut it).</p>

<p>The final talk by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Pomennedy">David Pomfret</a> was on the subject of typography. Now this is a bit of a hard subject for me as I&#8217;m pants at it (this site was a perfect example of that) so I was keen to hear what he had to say. David talked about the three main points when working with type - well the three main points that can fit into a 20 minute talk anyway - these were chose, use, and love. The main focus was on choosing the right type for the job, making sure it reflects the right personality, is readable (at all sizes), and contains everything you need (glyphs, drop caps, punctuation etc). When using your typography  David went on to say focus again on readability, using a good baseline to provide solid structure and working with a grid-system to produce a solid layout will all aid the typography you&#8217;ve chosen. And finally love typography, look at print - where it all started - and take inspiration from how they used typography to the fullest.</p>

<p>Overall Points Brighton was a fantastic event, it was well curated, in a suitable venue and provided not only fantastic talks but a really relaxed atmosphere to be able to talk with like-minded individuals over a beer (which were free thanks to some fantastic sponsors). Not forgetting the fantastic raffle with a ton of prizes donated by some more very kind sponsors which consisted of books and t-shirts, with the grand prize of the stunning full set of A Book Apart books. All proceeds from the tickets and the raffle went toward the charity Tia&#8217;s Trees and I think in the night Mike mentioned we had raised over £300! Very much looking forward to the next one, and sooner rather than later please!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently at One we&#8217;ve been considering a more collaborative way of working and this has led to most of us looking at the tools we use and how we develop. In this post I just want to quickly run through how I&#8217;ve recently changed the way I work and what tools and technologies I&#8217;ve started to use.</p>

<h2>My Mac setup</h2>


<p>At home I use a 13&#8221; MacBook Pro and have found myself really enjoying using the multiple desktops and gestures on the trackpad more and more. So because of this in the office I now have removed my second monitor and am using the iMac in the same way as the MacBook at home, <del datetime="2012-04-19T16:16:02+00:00">all I need now is a trackpad at work (you never know they may buy me one if I ask nicely)</del> I asked nicely and now I do have one which is making it a lot smoother.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found this style of setup really handy and it allows me to have some apps at full screen like my text editor and mail and then easily get between them with a simple four-finger swipe on the trackpad. At the office this also means I can put all my mail and twitter etc off on another desktop so I&#8217;m no longer distracted quite as often.</p>

<h2>MAMP</h2>


<p>Because we have recently moved to local development I&#8217;ve needed to set up a server environment on my Mac, I&#8217;ve tried both XAMP and MAMP but found the latter the easier to set up (although the issues I had with XAMP were probably more user related than software to be honest).</p>

<p>Also with the help of Clinton (<a href="http://twitter.com/iblamefish">@iblamefish</a>) I&#8217;ve set up my mac to give the development sites I&#8217;m working on local domains (in the form of http://mysite.dev), here&#8217;s how I did it (which is basically how Clinton told me too but I thought I&#8217;d share it):</p>

<ol>
    <li>First, personally I have set up a separate folder in the MAMP directory (/Applications/MAMP/sites/) to store all the local dev sites I&#8217;ll be working on. You can of course just use the htdocs folder by default but having this folder setup separately means I can use htdocs for little jobs that I&#8217;m happy accessing via localhost/site</li>
    <li>Next edit the Apache config file at /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf and uncomment the line which includes the &#8220;extra/httpd-vhosts.conf&#8221; file (line 525).</li>
    <li>Set up hosts for the site you&#8217;re creating in /Applications/MAMP/config/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf as below:
<pre>
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName mysite.dev
    DocumentRoot /Applications/MAMP/sites/mysite.dev/
</VirtualHost>
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Edit the local hosts file to tell your computer where mysite.dev is either logged in as superuser or via sudo (e.g. sudo vi /etc/hosts) and add in the line: 127.0.0.1  mysite.dev</li>
    <li>Restart Apache and then go to http://mysite.dev/ and you&#8217;re done.</li>
</ol>




<h2>Sublime Text 2</h2>


<p>I&#8217;ve only recently changed over to using Sublime Text 2 as my main editor and have found the transition fantastic and the tools available and excellent for how I code. Since I moved to a Mac from PC I&#8217;ve been using TextWrangler as it was a free editor and had SFTP (which for a long time in the office we&#8217;ve needed for all dev work). Since we&#8217;ve made the recent choice to move to local development it&#8217;s been less important for me to have SFTP and therefore I&#8217;ve had more chance to trial Sublime and it&#8217;s made life significantly easier.</p>

<p>Sublime for me is a nice compromise to using Vim, it may not be quite as powerful but the learning curve for Vim for me was a bit too steep and became time consuming when trying to work on quick projects. Sublime also is very expandable with a vast array of plugins that I&#8217;ve been making good use of, here&#8217;s a list of the plugins I have installed at the moment, most of which I found in <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/essential-sublime-text-2-plugins-and-extensions/">this article from Nettuts</a>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Package control</a> - install this first as it makes installing packages ridiculously easy</li>
    <li>SFTP</li>
    <li>Zen coding</li>
    <li>Git</li>
    <li>LESS</li>
    <li>Wordpress</li>
    <li>Search Wordpress codex</li>
    <li>jQuery functions</li>
    <li>Prefxr</li>
</ul>




<h2>LESS</h2>


<p>Since the beginning of the year I&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about LESS and introducing it to my dev setup. I learned a lot of the basics thanks to a brilliant <a href="http://www.12devsofxmas.co.uk/2011/12/less/">tutorial on the 12 Devs of Xmas site by Anthony Killeen</a>, but I really wanted to be using it on a more frequent basis to be able to get the most out of it. Unfortunately as I&#8217;m a part of a development team this is not something I can simply choose to do without it being discussed first and getting the unanimous nod from both the development team and our directors. Fortunately though it was a fairly easy decision to make as we all agreed that by using LESS we could become more productive and efficient producing sites as a team and with that getting the go-ahead from the directors wasn&#8217;t too hard.</p>

<p>So with the decision taken that we will where possible begin to develop in LESS I&#8217;ve began working on any new sites I build with LESS making use of things like the nested rules and variables etc. But what LESS has enabled us to do as a development team is to modularise our CSS into various mixins and build up a library of useful blocks of CSS that we can use on a variety of projects, at the moment what we have is fairly limited but over time as we build more and more in LESS we&#8217;ll be able to grow the library as we continue to build new sites.</p>

<h2>Codekit</h2>


<p>Of course working with LESS means that you need something to compile .less files into CSS. The LESS app is perfectly capable of this and I was initially using it when I started, however, a colleague pointed me towards Codekit (from the same people who make LESS.app) and I&#8217;ve found it to be much more powerful and makes your workflow so much smoother overall. The combination of LESS compiling, JS compile and concatenation, live browser reloading, and image optimisation all in one app is just mind-blowing! Also with functionality to compile SASS and Stylus files, Coffeescript and HAML/Jade it&#8217;s extremely useful for any development setup you have.</p>

<p>My favourite part of Codekit though has to be the project and framework management. The ability to create frameworks of LESS files (as mentioned), store them in one central location and include them in all of my projects using Codekit is incredible. It means I have the power to create a series of update-able sets of code libraries, store them in one single place and have them update across all of my projects.</p>

<p>Codekit&#8217;s still in beta at the moment and plan to release at some point next month to the app store with I think about a $9.99 price tag which for the functionality you receive is worth every penny!</p>

<h2>Git</h2>


<p>Finally I just want to touch quickly on Git/Github. I&#8217;ve never been part of a big coding company so version control has never really come up, but because of the usefulness of Github and the ease of use of Git I thought that I&#8217;d better add it to my repository. So I&#8217;m still getting used to using it but so far for storing several things that I&#8217;m working on I&#8217;ve found Git quite easy to get along with and with the use of Github I&#8217;ve been able to share some of the things I&#8217;ve been doing with colleagues. If you want to check out what I&#8217;ve done so far head over to <a href="http://github.com/onishiweb">http://github.com/onishiweb</a> and take a look, but be warned there&#8217;s really nothing that interesting over there at the moment.</p>

<p>So there we go, a brief look at the new setup I&#8217;ve been using and how it&#8217;s helped make me a lot more efficient and productive, would be great to hear how it compares to yours or whether you have any advice for other tools that I might find useful, so please comment or drop me a tweet! Cheers.</p>
