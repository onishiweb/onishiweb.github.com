  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s so much I could say about the last 3 days I&#8217;ve experienced in Brighton. I have to say experienced because I didn&#8217;t just go to any town, to any conference. I went to Brighton for <a href="http://updateconf.com/" target="_blank">Update 2011</a>: The Human Touch - iOS &amp; Beyond.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m a big advocate of conferences and I enjoy not only the opportunity to learn new stuff but the chance to network and meet new people. I can safely say I have never met so many amazing people in such a short time ever. I&#8217;ve also not been to a conference that ran as smoothly and had so much going on to compliment the conference, not forgetting the high class of speakers and workshops as well.</p>

<h2>Treated like Royalty</h2>


<p>The experience started with a trip to the Brighton Royal Pavilion for a pre-conference banquet and tour of the Pavilion, this place was ridiculous! From Asian style décor which consisted of expensive wood made to look like Bamboo to elegant statues with female heads on male bodies (and vice-versa) as well as a mechanism in their shoulders which made them the oldest bobble-heads I&#8217;ve ever laid eyes on! The meal was fantastic with plenty of banter between the web devs and musicians at our table and ended with us having both of our pineapple&#8217;s from the centerpiece sliced up by the waitress and I.</p>

<h2>A fresh take on conferences</h2>


<p>On to the conference day itself and it began with much needed coffee and meeting lots more new people in the bar before the start of proceedings. Obviously I have to mention the extremely interesting opening to the conference itself&#8230;Mr Aral Balkan singing his heart out with a live band welcoming us all to the day - now that is how a conference should start!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to try and keep this relatively short so won&#8217;t go through all the talks but there wasn&#8217;t a single one that disappointed. Matt Gemmell (Unusability), Sarah Parmenter (Designing for iOS), Jeremy Keith (One Web), Joachin Bondo (Going Beyond Delicious) and Cennydd Bowles (The Things of the Future) all gave some great inspiring and informative talks and I took quite a lot from them all. There were also music acts dotted throughout the day, the highlights being Ithaca Audio who live <a href="http://vimeo.com/25004046" target="_blank">mixed video clips</a> and a performance using the Microsoft Kinect to great effect. I have to also mention quickly the interview Aral did with Ronald Wayne the 3rd founder of Apple who was exceptional to listen to, a very inspiring and interesting man and I think Aral did a great job in bringing him to the conference and the interview itself.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I went to a Geek Ninja Battle Night which Aral organised and I was glad to see 2 of them during the conference day both equally great but completely contrasting which I think showed how great a tool it is. The first on platforms did the word &#8220;Battle&#8221; in the title very proud as 2 extremely passionate people argued they&#8217;re points superbly, however I have to agree with Seb Lee-Delisle who mentioned that he sits on the fence and that there&#8217;s a time and a place for both. The second on tools, technologies and design challenges was more collaborative but some good opinions were expressed and all that contributed gave great advice and examples of how to approach a variety of problems and what really winds them up!</p>

<h2>Top notch stuff</h2>


<p>So there are 3 talks I haven&#8217;t mentioned and they were the ones that I thought were fantastically inspiring, entertaining, educational and deeply concerning. Seb Lee-Delisle did a live coding example of how to make an Angry Birds clone using Corona and presented in such a great fashion that I was engaged throughout and left me wanting to go play with the platform. Relly Annett-Baker did another of my favourite talks entitled &#8220;Ass over Tit&#8221; which I think sums up her personality and style of presenting brilliantly. She was great to watch and spoke lots of truths about how we do things backwards as devs and tend to leave the most important things till pretty much last. She also made me very jealous throughout her talk speaking of her recent trips to CERN - oh and not forgetting Italy&#8217;s &#8220;Physics Bucket&#8221;.</p>

<p>My favourite talk by far however was by the very young and extremely wise for her age Anna Debenham, talking about how incredibly rubbish our schools are at delivering even the basic knowledge about IT (the internet is not owned by Microsoft!). The standard of education about the web as well is so poor all that&#8217;s taught most of the time is the &#8220;Save as web page&#8221; button in Word or Powerpoint, which just makes you angry! Her talk resonated with me also because I&#8217;m not long out of University and have for the last year or so been becoming more concerned about the lack of good education and foundation knowledge that is delivered in degree courses. However she pointed out that it goes much further than this and that in an extremely modern and digital world children are just not getting enough good education in how they can be a part of it. I was also very lucky to speak to Anna later that evening about what she does to try and improve this aspect of education given to children but it seems like she&#8217;s fighting a tough battle as even when she can get into a school to give presentations and workshops she&#8217;s extremely limited by what the schools will allow to go on their networks, something as simple as having an up-to-date browser is like climbing Everest it seems.</p>

<h2>A great finish</h2>


<p>Anyway getting back to the rest of the conference, it goes without saying, I&#8217;ve been thoroughly inspired once again and I&#8217;ve got some new found motivation for my work and for things that I want to do thanks to the speakers and happenings during the conference day. Of course no conference would be complete without a boozy after-party and once again Update didn&#8217;t disappoint with A Night at the Museum! Yep that&#8217;s correct, Aral only went and hired a flipping museum for us all to go have fun in. I don&#8217;t really think I can say much more than that other than I met some fantastic people again and had some interesting talks about the art and exhibitions in the museum.</p>

<h2>Workshopping</h2>


<p>I feel pretty guilty as due to the partying the inevitable lack of sleep meant I wasn&#8217;t at my best today for Drew&#8217;s workshop and also still being fairly new to iOS development I wasn&#8217;t able to complete many of the exercises without jumping ahead and looking at the solutions. Drew however encouraged me to do so and I managed to take a lot from the day and given a few more months working on it I would be confident I&#8217;d be able to get a lot out of the things I learned today thanks to Drew.</p>

<p>So there you have it, these last few days have been an incredible experience and certainly one of the best conferences I&#8217;ve attended so far. Aral&#8217;s experience as a conference speaker I think allowed him to put together something really interesting and unlike any others that have gone before. The combination of speakers, live coding, Geek Ninja battles, music acts and also the show and tell stage which I&#8217;ve not even mentioned here was certainly a winning formula and topped off with the offer of a range of workshops from leading industry professionals and some amazing social events I can safely say I will not be forgetting this for a long, long time.</p>

<p>Thanks Aral and the Update Team who made this all possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well here I am sat on the train waiting to head back home after what has been an amazing day out at the first ever Apple Cart festival in Victoria Park.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d write a little bit about what I&#8217;ve seen, from the good stuff to the not so good and the extremely weird! It&#8217;s been a bit of a long day so bare with me if I ramble a little, I&#8217;ve had a few beers too but hopefully this will all make sense&#8230;</p>

<h2>The highlights</h2>


<p>Happy days being sung in German (can&#8217;t remember exactly who did this, please help!)
Comedian Mark Steel getting heckled by a 4 year old
Huddling under a very pretty lady&#8217;s umbrella as the rain started coming down
Churros!
Jeremiah weed bourbon ale
Gilles Peterson dancing away merrily behind his decks
And of course the amazing Tim Minchin</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-117 alignnone" title="Churros" src="http://www.onishiweb.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-07-08-2011-15-09-40.jpeg" alt="Amazing Churros" /></p>

<h2>The lowlights</h2>


<p>My back getting soaked through from the rain coming down off a tent
Not getting the number of the girl I joined under her umbrella
Badly drawn boy (unfortunately - I will explain)
The shortness of Tim&#8217;s set (45 mins is not enough haha)</p>

<h2>The weird</h2>


<p>A man dressed in a sparkling leotard singing very strange songs in the cabaret tent
The urinals
The spanking station!</p>

<p>I first heard about the Apple Cart Festival after Tim Minchin tweeted that he would be headlining; so almost instantly I jumped online and got myself one and so did a couple of friends Andy and Zanny, who I don&#8217;t get to see enough so it was great to spend some time with them today.</p>

<p>We got there relatively early and checked out what was on offer with the handy map and schedule while relaxing with a Pimms outside the Pimms bus - the festival guide also had a great Don&#8217;t Miss! list which highlighted things to be on the look out for, great little addition at a small festival with a lot of new acts. There were 5 stages in total, the main stage, a cabaret tent, folk tent, comedy stage and the magic tent, as well as a lot of food stands around the village green, a penguin books tent/stall and the art car boot fair (home of the spanking station).</p>

<h2>All about the comedy</h2>


<p>To be honest the music line up wasn&#8217;t amazing (personal opinion obviously, it seemed to generate a good crowd for most of the day), the top acts on the main stage were The Magic Numbers (early afternoon oddly), Badly Drawn Boy and Tim Minchin. So we spent most of our time in the Comedy tent which always seemed pretty packed. There were some great acts, some which I&#8217;ve seen around on TV and a couple of new and very funny acts. The stand-out stand-ups were Jon Richardson, Doc Brown and Mark Steel but other acts like Paul Chowdry and Kevin Eldon are worth a mention.</p>

<p>At one point at the Comedy tent we were stood on the edge of the tent when the most almighty rain shower hit during Jon Richardson&#8217;s set - cue me befriending the hot girl with the umbrella - at which point Jon asked if people could come inside a bit more but a few very nice people sitting down jumped up and made everyone else do so too and suddenly the tent was rammed (I still got soaked as the water ran off the awning down my back on my way in). Another highlight in the comedy tent was during Mark Steel&#8217;s set, whilst pouring down with rain a lady came and collected her 2 children to take them out because of the rather fruitful language Mark was using (there were parental guidance warnings so nothing to complain about) and after Mark had commented on probably swearing too much a 4 year old jumped up in the crowd shouting &#8220;You&#8217;re a very naughty man!&#8221;. As funny as the exchange was between Mark and the 4 year old it went on a little long (as most kids do) but Mark&#8217;s handled it brilliantly and despite trying to curtail his language a little he failed pretty badly for the rest of the set.</p>

<h3>&#8220;The Tim Minchin of rap&#8221;!</h3>


<p>Must also mention Doc Brown who in the festival guide was touted as &#8220;The Tim Minchin of rap&#8221; and he certainly didn&#8217;t disappoint, a very funny comedian and the rap interludes complimented his stand-up superbly and finishing by incorporating the crowd as his &#8220;hype-men&#8221; was a great end to the set.</p>

<h2>Badly Mannered Boy</h2>


<p>The only lowlight I&#8217;ll mention (apart from getting soaked), was the impression Badly Drawn Boy (Damon Gough) gave me after I got to the main stage towards the end of his set. Now maybe I missed something and really he was quite good and funny and whatnot but it seemed as if he really didn&#8217;t give a shit about being there. He seemed rather arrogant and didn&#8217;t really care too much about what people thought about it, half starting songs and then saying &#8220;actually I can&#8217;t remember how that one starts&#8230;I&#8217;ll do something else&#8221; and carrying on well over time and eventually having to be told to leave the stage (he still did 2 more songs). Now I&#8217;m happy to hold my hands up and say that I missed the point and had I been there for the whole set I&#8217;d have a completely different opinion but his attitude left me feeling a little disappointed as I really do like his music.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-118" title="Tim on a speaker" src="http://www.onishiweb.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tim-e1312835090392.jpg" alt="Tim Minchin stood on a speaker on the main stage of the Apple Cart festival" /></p>

<p>Finally I&#8217;ll give a little mention to a small act called Tim Minchin (and his band Brad and Pete). Nothing new from Tim this time, he played some of the classics: Rock N Roll Nerd, Prejudice, You Grew On Me; and a couple of the newer ones from the last year or so: The Good Book, Cont and the opening to CHEESE as well as finishing as always with Darkside. He opted to keep the chat short and to the point  and play more songs which giving the short time slot was welcomed by the audience although I was a bit disappointed to hear him mention a bit on grammar he was going to do. Him and the band did however throw in a little bit at the end of The Good Book, playing a coda for the audience to dance to which was good fun, so overall another great performance from Tim as usual!</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s it from me, I managed to get back to Marylebone in time for the last fast train home so not a bad one after all, there&#8217;s a few more of my pics from the day in the slideshow below, hope you enjoy them and thanks for reading.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently taken it upon myself to get into iOS development. As the owner of both an iPhone and an iPad I use iOS on a daily basis and as that&#8217;s sparked an interest for me to start developing for the devices as well, just as using the internet made me want to build websites. So after finally getting my hands on a MacBook Pro (lovely machine that it is), I&#8217;ve been able to delve into Xcode and start creating.</p>

<p>As a web developer of a couple of years experience and having spent 4 years at University learning to program in things like C, C++ and Delphi I have enough of an understanding of basic programming and development environments so at least I have a good base to work from when it comes to learning to develop for iOS. Also as someone who is going to be following a lot of tutorials and reading books aplenty over the next few months I thought it would be good to document my progress and also try and write some tutorials from my perspective as a newbie iOS developer.</p>

<p>So I wrote the tutorial over a few nights last week and it&#8217;s now up on the brilliant <a href="http://ios-blog.co.uk/">iPhone application development</a> blog. Now that&#8217;s all done though it&#8217;s back to the books and online tutorials so that I can get myself on track to putting together some proper iOS apps in the near future. In the meantime I&#8217;ll leave you with a few of the resources that I&#8217;ve been using to learn iOS development and am continuing to read on almost a nightly basis.</p>

<p>The book: Beginning iPhone 4 Development, by Dave Mark, Jack Nutting and Jeff LaMarche.
The book I want: The iPhone Developer&#8217;s Cookbook (iOS 3 version as recommended by Brendan Dawes)
The websites: <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">Mobiletuts+</a>, <a href="http://membership.thinkvitamin.com/" target="_blank">Think Vitamin Membership</a> and <a href="http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Jeff LaMarche&#8217;s iPhone Development Blog</a>.
I&#8217;m also going to be attending <a href="http://updateconf.com" target="_blank">Update Conference</a> in September which is aimed at all things mobile including iOS and as well as a conference there are some workshops going on from some of the top developers/designers around, one of which I&#8217;ll be attending.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to venture into public speaking for some time now and recently thanks to Science Oxford Live&#8217;s PechaKucha night I was giving an opportunity to break my public speaking cherry as it were.</p>

<h2>PechaKucha</h2>


<p>PechaKucha is a presentation style devised in Japan. Based on a simple concept of 20 images, 20 seconds for each. It keeps the presentation going quickly, very quickly as I found out. You can go to <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/">pecha-kucha.org</a> for more details and to see some examples.</p>

<p>This was the second PechaKucha night Science Oxford had put on and seeing @iblamefish speak at the last one I thought I&#8217;d give it a try as a bit of an entry-point into public speaking. The call for talks was quite generic and a relation to science would be a bonus, so I went for something I&#8217;m pretty passionate about and got lucky as the link to science is rather strong. I&#8217;ve been interested in Formula One for as long as I can remember and as the sport is constantly pushing the boundaries of science to go as quick as possible I thought it was a good choice.</p>

<p>So with topic decided I needed to do a little bit more research and try and get together a presentation on the science bits behind the fastest sport on 4 wheels! So with a couple of months to prepare I did what would make the past student part of me proud, I put it off until the week before the night itself.</p>

<h2>The night</h2>


<p>The night of the talk I think I&#8217;d ran through it maybe once completely after overrunning on the first 3 slides about 5 times, turns out that 20 seconds really isn&#8217;t that long after all. I planned about 3-4 sentences per photo and it seemed I could barely get through 2 :/ so basically what that taught me is that I should really plan a talk a little further in advance to give myself a little longer to test it out, rookie mistake.</p>

<p>After finally getting over to Science Oxford and getting the slides loaded up on the computer I waited around with the hosts and a couple of other speakers for things to begin. When we got settled down for the talks to begin I actually had no idea in which order the talks were going in apart from a cursory glance at a list which had me in 4th, turns out I was second!</p>

<p>The talk went, well, quickly&#8230;it seemed that no longer had I got up there I was pretty much sitting back down again. A couple of things I did notice while I was speaking was that I mainly spoke to one person in the audience (the guy pretty much straight in front of me) and even though I had notes for each slide I managed mostly not to look at them as I just reeled off the first things I could remember for that slide as I was extremely aware of small amount of time I had.</p>

<h2>The result</h2>


<p>Afterwards there were a couple of questions, one being do I have any involvement with F1 and am I paid to do this sort of thing, the very short answer to that was &#8216;no&#8217; unfortunately you don&#8217;t have to pay me to talk about F1 but if anybody would like to I&#8217;ll happily accept!</p>

<p>All in all I&#8217;m pretty happy with how things went, I could have done more prep and maybe given myself some more time to run through it some more and make adjustments but as a first go it wasn&#8217;t too bad. And the whole speaking in front of strangers wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought and I would happily do it again. I was speaking to one of the other speakers at the end of the night who asked if I would do the presentation again for kids which would be an experience I guess but why not&#8230;</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently through both my experience and after reading an article in the newspaper from the recent new adventures conference I started thinking more about what education does for people who want to get into this industry and where it&#8217;s falling short. So is it time the web industry educated educational institutions?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only recently entered the web industry as a front end developer, before that I was a student at Oxford Brookes University where I studied computer science, which included many subjects, some of which were based around web design. From my education I was taught the basics of PHP and JavaScript and built on my knowledge of HTML and CSS, however since taking on my job after leaving Uni I found myself thrown in a the proverbial deep end!</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s not good enough is it!</h2>


<p>So basically what I&#8217;m trying to say is I feel my education didn&#8217;t prepare me very well for the real world. Isn&#8217;t that what they&#8217;re supposed to do? I went into the industry having not used a CMS, didn&#8217;t know much about fonts (didn&#8217;t really even know the web fonts properly) and any idea of learning actual design at Uni was left to recommended reading&#8230;is that really good enough?</p>

<p>And from speaking to my current employer (and I would like to hear opinions from other companies and industry leaders) a degree is not exactly the first thing on the shopping list of requirements in a job applicant any more.</p>

<p>So what can be done about this? I think the answer is for the web industry to get involved more with education and help to improve the current curriculum to help students who want to learn web design and development, learn it to a point where the businesses will be able to more readily consider them a serious applicant.</p>

<h2>What do we do from here then?</h2>


<p>There are a few ways that this could be solved, the web industry could work closer with Universities and attempt to improve the curriculum, companies could offer placements for work experience and gap years for students. And what about education outside of Universities and colleges? I know internships are fairly commonplace in our industry but another idea I had thought of was what about a web industry apprenticeships?</p>

<p>Well I&#8217;m happy to say that recently that idea has been taken on by someone who spoke at a conference I recently attended, enter Mr Mark Boulton. While sat on twitter sometime last week I noticed a tweet from Mark saying</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Two job opportunities @<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/markboultondsg">markboultondsg</a>: Web Designer and Web Design Apprentice:<a title="http://www.markboultondesign.com/jobs" rel="nofollow" href="http://t.co/Uj0Ndc7" target="_blank">http://t.co/Uj0Ndc7</a>&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>and instantly I was intrigued to see what was going on.</p>

<p>Mark posted a link to a blog post a day or so later explaining his reasons for taking on a web design apprentice, saying</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Internships are the norm in our industry. I did it, and it was mostly great. But the thing is; it didn’t pay well and I was only there for a few months.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>and</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;An Apprentice is something completely different. It’s a commitment to teach and nurture you over a given period of time.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>All I can say is that I wholeheartedly agree with what Mark is doing and can only wish him the best in doing so. I also hope that this might start off a new way of educating people in the ways of our industry as it&#8217;s not only a great way of doing so but also has the potential to happen quickly. Which lets be honest is the best thing about how our industry works!</p>

<p>I think now more than ever it&#8217;s important that we look to improve how people come in to our industry as what I&#8217;ve seen recently is it maturing and finally starting to be taken more seriously as a profession, we can&#8217;t continue to do this with people being poorly educated at the first level. Otherwise we&#8217;re going to be heading into that inevitable situation where companies only look for people experience and students are completely unable to get that experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, so I&#8217;m a web developer, nothing more nothing less (well I can use photoshop and now a little illustrator). I&#8217;ve been doing this for about 18 months professionally and a year or two academically before (more on that later, in another random post), so I&#8217;m fairly new to the web industry as a whole. This is my first job as a professional developer and it&#8217;s in a company which deals in not only web but print as well and this has been an interesting experience ever since the first day.</p>

<h2>Curiosity killed the cat</h2>


<p>I&#8217;m a naturally curious person. I like to know all that I can about things that interest me, maybe not all at once (if I did I&#8217;d have about 20 books on the go) but if I see an opportunity to learn something I&#8217;ll take it. Some find it strange that I watch things like Stargazing or Mythbusters as they see it as educational rather than entertaining, but why shouldn&#8217;t you enjoy learning something new? It&#8217;d be a pretty boring world if we only knew things because we had to! I mean who knows what you&#8217;ll learn that might turn up in a quiz night one day. So working here has allowed me to learn not only about the world of the web but also that of print and more recently event management (we do lots around here).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been interesting getting to see other people work on leaflets, magazines and books while I sit happily in the corner coding away. I get to see a lot of different things that comes in and a real variety in the stuff that we produce. If I find an excuse to go upstairs (where the designers live) there&#8217;s always about 6 different projects going on and I sometimes find myself transfixed on someone&#8217;s screen while they do some quite routine thing in illustrator which is new to me (sorry Tom). And I like to think the same happens for some of the designers when they sit and see me tidying up the styling on a website or something just as arbitrary to me.</p>

<p>It also means the office is full of really different people, mostly all creative but in really diverse ways and with varying personalities. I know there are a few of these companies out there but I also know there&#8217;s a lot that just specialise in web design or print design individually and after the experiences I&#8217;ve had here I&#8217;m really not sure I&#8217;d want to work in a place with only the one speciality.</p>

<h2>I thought you weren&#8217;t meant to like your job?</h2>


<p>At the heart of it, I am still only a developer, I don&#8217;t do any design here at all, I leave that to the people with the knowledge and experience to do so. However that doesn&#8217;t mean I sit back and do exactly as I&#8217;m told and not attempt to contribute to the design or ideas in some form or another. If that means an idea in a meeting or adding something to the page a designer couldn&#8217;t via CSS or jQuery. I still like to be active in the process of creating the site rather than be just another developer robot that sits and codes all day&#8230; I also like to concern myself with how I put a site together, thinking about how I can produce cleaner markup or creating clever effects using CSS instead of having to resort to graphics (I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun with HTML5 recently, makes a page look a lot more semantic than div div div div).</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s about it really, just me rambling on about the job I do&#8230;I enjoy what I do, I enjoy the people I work with and most of all I like the company that I work for, their a mad bunch but it kinda feels like we&#8217;re all part of that madness in some way or another. If you want to check out this odd bunch I&#8217;m talking about you can go to <a href="http://www.oneltd.co.uk">www.oneltd.co.uk</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now I&#8217;m fully aware that at time of writing there are countless numbers of people who have already given very concise and detailed reviews of their experiences of the recent New Adventures conference in Nottingham. At one point it even got to the stage where I considered not writing this post because there were so many. But I&#8217;m thinking sod it, why not have my say on what I thought was a really enthralling day which not only allowed me to hear about new ideas in the industry but also be part of an amazing collection of like minded people.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>


<p>The main feeling I took away from my time spent in Nottingham was the overall community feel of the conference. From the first tweet I read way back in June/July there has been a lot of talk of who would be attending, what ideas were going to be discussed and a rather healthy amount of people contributing to the goings on in and around the conference itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.onishiweb.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/5399701266_644ea88038.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35" title="Erskine Bowling" src="http://www.onishiweb.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/5399701266_644ea88038.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>
<small>The pre-conference night at Erskine Bowling by Paul Robert Lloyd</small></p>

<p>I went to the conference eager to meet many people I&#8217;ve only so far known as @thisperson or @thatperson. Thanks to the Erskine bowling the night before and the Escucha after party I was able to wander round and just talk to people who seemed happy to do the same. As scary as that is to someone not really comfortable in walking around talking to various unknown people, it was the overriding community feel that gave me the confidence to do so and I can honestly say it wouldn&#8217;t have been the same conference without it!</p>

<h2>The conference day</h2>


<p>Moving on to the main reason we were all there (the conference itself - the after party being a close second), the day was full of interesting speakers, some whom I&#8217;d seen talk before but most were for the first time.</p>

<p>Although the day started a little later than planned - due to a mass amount of people trying to come through two doors to register - it wasn&#8217;t the best of starts but by no means Simon&#8217;s fault and he handled it extremely well keeping everyone up to date on goings on. Although it did leave me sitting in the relatively uncomfortable seats for a little long.</p>

<p>Once we finally got underway Dan Rubin started with one of my favourite talks of the day. Speaking about the language we use in our industry he spoke of borrowed terms and phrases that we use and how although sometimes they work, when coming from a closely related profession can lead to confusion (there is NO fold on the web!). I couldn&#8217;t agree more with what he was saying and speaking to him later in the evening we both thought that although evolving the language of an industry takes time it won&#8217;t happen unless people start talking about it and make others more aware.</p>

<p>It would take me an age to go through all of the talks one by one like that so I will just mention a few others that left me thinking. Andy Clarke spoke about story-telling on the web, using examples from film and comics (great use of the comic too) showed how timing and flow can be controlled and altered by effective layout of the content. Elliot Jay Stocks spoke about a responsibility in how we use certain aspects of design and how just using things because they&#8217;re available is not always right. Both talks were brilliantly thought provoking and left me with new ideas to take into future projects.</p>

<p>I must be honest and say that the post-lunch talks didn&#8217;t come across quite as well as many of the others, this could have possibly been down to the timing however the topics may not have helped either. Veerle Pieters tackled inspiration which I think is always a hard subject to talk about being such a personal thing. I found myself not getting into it as much, although I was able to see how her process is very effective. Also the conclusions from Greg Wood&#8217;s talk about Art Direction on the web seemed fairly obvious, in that an article with art directed content would work better against a plain text version.</p>

<small>Brendan Dawes talking Produced for Use - yes that&#8217;s a pencil in a cat&#8217;s ass. By Andreas Dantz</small></p>

<p>The final talk from Brendan Dawes - who always grasps my attention thanks to his overwhelming ease with which he speaks - again left me contemplating the worth of what we produce in his brilliant talk on &#8220;produced for use&#8221;. He spoke about creating things with a real purpose rather than just for the sake of it, with a couple of fantastic ideas of his own.</p>

<p>From talking with others and reading some of the other reviews I have to agree that the length of the day was a little too long. It would have been completely reasonable to cut the number of speakers down to 8 and maybe give more time to networking breaks or a slightly earlier finish.</p>

<p>The Q&amp;A session although experimental promised more than they delivered but I don&#8217;t think this was down to the speakers or Simon as I think better questions could have been asked and it all felt a little rushed with some of the speakers concerned that they&#8217;re answers were too lengthy opposed to answering them well.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>


<p>Overall I had a fantastic experience at New Adventures, the majority of the speakers and the community feel of the event left me filled with more enthusiasm for my industry than ever and gave me ideas to take things further in the work I do. A thoroughly good job done by Simon Collison and will be looking forward to hopefully being there again next year!</p>

<h3>Thanks:</h3>
