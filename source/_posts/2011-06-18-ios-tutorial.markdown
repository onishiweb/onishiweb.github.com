I've recently taken it upon myself to get into iOS development. As the owner of both an iPhone and an iPad I use iOS on a daily basis and as that's sparked an interest for me to start developing for the devices as well, just as using the internet made me want to build websites. So after finally getting my hands on a MacBook Pro (lovely machine that it is), I've been able to delve into Xcode and start creating.

As a web developer of a couple of years experience and having spent 4 years at University learning to program in things like C, C++ and Delphi I have enough of an understanding of basic programming and development environments so at least I have a good base to work from when it comes to learning to develop for iOS. Also as someone who is going to be following a lot of tutorials and reading books aplenty over the next few months I thought it would be good to document my progress and also try and write some tutorials from my perspective as a newbie iOS developer.

So I wrote the tutorial over a few nights last week and it's now up on the brilliant <a href="http://ios-blog.co.uk/">iPhone application development</a> blog. Now that's all done though it's back to the books and online tutorials so that I can get myself on track to putting together some proper iOS apps in the near future. In the meantime I'll leave you with a few of the resources that I've been using to learn iOS development and am continuing to read on almost a nightly basis.

The book: Beginning iPhone 4 Development, by Dave Mark, Jack Nutting and Jeff LaMarche.
The book I want: The iPhone Developer's Cookbook (iOS 3 version as recommended by Brendan Dawes)
The websites: <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">Mobiletuts+</a>, <a href="http://membership.thinkvitamin.com/" target="_blank">Think Vitamin Membership</a> and <a href="http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Jeff LaMarche's iPhone Development Blog</a>.
I'm also going to be attending <a href="http://updateconf.com" target="_blank">Update Conference</a> in September which is aimed at all things mobile including iOS and as well as a conference there are some workshops going on from some of the top developers/designers around, one of which I'll be attending.
