I'm sat on the train heading back from what is likely the last ever [New Adventures](http://2013.newadventuresconf.com/) conference. As much as that makes me kinda sad to say that it might not happen again, it's been a great few days and a truly great end to the first month of 2013.

New Adventures was one of the first conferences I attended when it ran for the first time back in 2011, I had been in the industry for about 15 months and hadn't really found out much about the community around the web industry. I had attended FOWD2010 but that had been with the other developers at work and I hadn't really met many people there, they were just people. New Adventures showed me there was a much bigger community around what we do and it made me want to be a part of it.

This year was no different. Except for me that instead of knowing almost no one, I knew a ridiculous amount of people, and met many more new folk as well. I think the extra events around the conference really help to promote this in the community and the [Erskine](http://erskinedesign.com/) bowling and the (abandoned) [Fr00tball](http://twitter.com/fr00tball) were some great opportunities to meet people and get to know the community.

The conference day itself was another fantastic success as well, I remember coming away from 2011 bursting with new ideas and things I wanted to do. This year is no different. The talks from [Tiago Pedras](http://twitter.com/tiagopedras) and [Jessica Hische](http://twitter.com/jessicahische) gave me confidence that things I'm working on and the way I want to work are worthwhile and gave me the motivation to push on with them. [Jason Santa Maria](http://twitter.com/jasonsantamaria) and [Jon Tan](http://twitter.com/jontangerine)'s talks make me think more about what I'm doing and how to approach new things. I remember seeing Jon's talk from 2011 and being just as inspired.

Having [Seb Lee-Delisle](http://twitter.com/seb_ly) take the stage straight after lunch was a great decision, his enthusiasm and fun approach to his talks were brilliant to wake up the crowd after getting suitably full from lunch. I always enjoy watching Seb speak at events, I've seen him do similar talks 2 or 3 times in the last year or so and I'd happily watch him many times over.

Thanks to all the other speakers as well who did a great job, I don't think I heard a single person say something bad about any of the talks with everyone taking away something different things from a variety of the talks. There's few I really want to watch again especially [Stephanie Troeth](http://twitter.com/sniffles)'s talk, when it's up on [Besquare](http://besquare.me), I really liked the idea behind the talk but need to hear it again as there was so much to take in!

Finally I just want to say thank you again to Simon and Greg and all those involved with the conference, thank you for the last few years hard work, I missed the second year which I wish I hadn't but am so glad I made it back for the third! Thank you.
